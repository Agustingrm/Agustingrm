# Lovely to meet you! I'm Agustin

Welcome to my GitHub space! I'm glad you dropped by. Here's a bit about me:

## 👨‍💻 Who Am I?

I am a primarily self-taught programmer currently residing in Germany. I have a strong passion for frontend development, especially in exploring different frameworks and emerging technologies. Though my focus is on frontend work, I'm also capable of handling backend tasks. Professionally, I'm a full-time programmer, but in my leisure time, I prefer to step away from screens and engage in various sports. Currently, I'm really into bouldering, but I always enjoy trying new things in life

## 🌐 My Work

Currently, I'm working with a German start-up that's on a mission to make the world a bit greener. We're encouraging employees in large companies to choose trains over planes, aiding in the reduction of their CO₂ emissions. At this start-up, I'm part of the development team, where I handle a bit of everything, with a primary focus on frontend development.

## 💻 Tools I Have Been Using So Far

## 🚀 What I'm Up To

I'm continuously broadening my skill set, with a focus on improving my coding quality. Currently, I'm not delving deeply into any new languages, but rather I'm concentrating on understanding design patterns and best practices in coding.
